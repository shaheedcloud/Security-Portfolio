# 🔐 Shaheed Hayatuddin — Security Portfolio

**Focus:** Cloud & Information Security • Networking • Active Directory • Pentesting  
Hands-on, evidence-driven labs built in a hybrid homelab using **pfSense, Wazuh, AWS, and Azure**.

---

## 📁 Structure
- **/networking** — pfSense firewall rules, Suricata/Zeek, Wireshark/NetFlow evidence  
- **/pentesting** — OWASP Juice Shop tests, Nmap/Burp workflow, automation scripts, reports  
- **/active-directory** — AD hardening, LAPS, Sysmon, BloodHound analysis, detections  
- **/cloud** — AWS & Azure labs, IAM mapping, GuardDuty/CloudTrail/Defender detections  
- **/reports** — executive summaries, incident timelines, playbooks  
- **/leadership** — hiring rubric, onboarding plan, stakeholder briefs

1. **Three-Zone Network + IDS** — pfSense + Suricata + NetFlow  
   - Evidence: `networking/suricata/rules.rules`, `networking/evidence/recon.pcap`, `reports/network_lab_report.pdf`

2. **Web App Pentest + Detection Mapping** — OWASP Juice Shop  
   - Evidence: `pentesting/scans/juiceshop.xml`, `pentesting/reports/juiceshop.pdf`

3. **AD Hardening & Identity Defense** — Sysmon, LAPS, detections  
   - Evidence: `active-directory/sysmon-config/Sysmon.xml`, `reports/ad_hardening_playbook.pdf`

4. **Cloud Security Integration** — AWS/Azure mapping  
   - Evidence: `cloud/aws/terraform/`, `cloud/aws/screenshots/guardduty.png`

## 🧠 Method
Threat → Attack Surface → **Evidence** → Protection → Tradeoffs.  
Every lab includes a short executive summary and a technical annex.
